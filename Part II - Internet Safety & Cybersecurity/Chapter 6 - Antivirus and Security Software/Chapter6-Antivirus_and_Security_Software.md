## Understanding Computer Security: The Basics

Think of your computer like your home—you want to keep the bad guys out, but you also need to let the good guys (legitimate programs) in.

### The Digital Bad Guys:

* **Viruses:** Digital diseases that delete files, slow down your computer, or steal information.
* **Malware:** The umbrella term for all malicious (bad) software. It includes viruses, but also the threats below.
* **Adware:** Programs that bombard you with unwanted advertisements, slowing your computer and tracking you online.
* **Spyware:** Software that secretly watches what you do (passwords, credit cards) and reports back to criminals.
* **Browser Hijacks:** When software takes control of your web browser, changing your home page, search engine, or redirecting you to fake sites.

### How Infections Happen (So You Can Avoid Them)

Understanding how these threats get onto your computer is your first line of defense:

* **Email Attachments:** Never open attachments from unknown people. Even friends' emails might be infected.
* **Fake Software Downloads:** Always download software from the **official website**.
* **Infected Websites:** Some sites automatically download malware to your computer just by visiting them.
* **Social Engineering:** When criminals trick you into installing malware by pretending to be helpful (e.g., a pop-up that says "Your computer is infected! Click here to clean it!").

## Choosing Antivirus Software: What Actually Works

*Based on 20+ years of field experience removing malware*

**The Truth About Antivirus Software:** No single antivirus program catches everything. That's why professional computer technicians use multiple tools.

### Windows Defender: Your Built-In Protection

Good News: If you have Windows 10 or 11, you already have decent antivirus protection built-in.

| What Windows Defender Does Well | What Windows Defender Doesn't Do |
| :--- | :--- |
| Automatically scans files as you download them. | Doesn't catch everything (especially newer threats). |
| Updates itself regularly. | Limited protection against browser hijacks. |
| Free with Windows. | Fewer features than paid alternatives. |

### Professional-Grade Tools (What We Actually Use)

| Category | Product | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary (Paid)** | Bitdefender Antivirus Plus / Kaspersky Total Security | Excellent detection rates; provides full-time, proactive protection. |
| **Primary (Free)** | Windows Defender | Good enough for careful users with good browsing habits. |
| **Cleanup Tool** | **Malwarebytes Anti-Malware** (Our #1 Recommendation) | Excellent at finding threats other programs miss. Essential for cleanup. |
| **Cleanup Tool** | **ADWCleaner** (Free Tool from Malwarebytes) | Specializes in removing browser hijacks and annoying adware. |

## Step-By-Step: Cleaning an Infected Computer

*Adapted from our professional virus removal procedures*

> ⚠️ **Important Safety Warning:** If your computer handles sensitive information (banking, business), and you suspect a keylogger, **stop using it for sensitive activities immediately.** Change your passwords from a different, clean computer.

### Signs Your Computer Might Be Infected:

* Dramatically **Slow Performance** (long startup/program open times).
* **Pop-up Advertisements** when you're not browsing the internet.
* **Changed Browser Settings** (different home page or search engine).
* **Unexpected Programs** you don't remember installing.

</p>

### The Professional Cleaning Process

**Step 1: Disconnect from the Internet**

* **Why:** Prevents the malware from downloading more infections or sending your information to criminals.
* **How:** Unplug your ethernet cable or turn off WiFi.

**Step 2: Boot to Safe Mode**

Safe Mode loads Windows with minimal programs, making it easier to remove malware.

* **For Windows 10/11:** Hold the **Shift** key while clicking **"Restart."**
* Choose "Troubleshoot" → "Advanced Options" → "Startup Settings."
* Click "Restart" and then press **"4"** for Safe Mode.

**Step 3: Run Multiple Scans (Professional Approach)**

*Run these scans IN ORDER. Each tool catches different types of malware.*

1.  **First: ADWCleaner** (Specializes in adware/browser hijacks).
    * Run the program (no installation needed) and click **"Scan Now."**
    * Click **"Clean & Repair"** and restart when prompted.
2.  **Second: Malwarebytes Anti-Malware** (Specializes in trojans/spyware).
    * Run a **full system scan** (not quick scan).
    * Remove all detected items and restart if prompted.
3.  **Third: Your Regular Antivirus** (Windows Defender or your paid suite).
    * Update your program and run a **full system scan** one last time.

**Step 4: Check All Web Browsers**

*For Each Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge):*

* Remove suspicious extensions/add-ons.
* Reset your home page and default search engine.
* Clear browser data (cache, cookies, history).

**Step 5: Update Everything**

* Install all available **Windows Updates**.
* Update your **Browser** and essential software (like Adobe Reader/Java).

**Step 6: Create a Clean Restore Point**

After cleaning, create a system restore point so you can return to this clean state if needed.

## Prevention: Your Best Defense

**The 90% Rule:** 90% of computer infections are preventable with good habits.

### Safe Computing Habits:

* **Email Safety:** Never open attachments from strangers. Call the sender to verify if an urgent message is suspicious.
* **Download Safety:** Only download software from **official websites**. Avoid "Download Now" buttons in pop-up ads.
* **Browser Safety:** Keep your browser updated and use an **ad blocker** to reduce exposure to malicious ads.
* **General Safety:** Keep Windows updated and use caution with USB drives from other people.

### Setting Up Automatic Protection:

* **Windows Updates:** Set Windows to install updates automatically (and don't postpone security updates).
* **Antivirus Updates:** Make sure your antivirus updates automatically and schedule weekly full scans.

## When to Call a Professional

*Based on our professional service experience*

You should call for help when:

* **Financial Security is Compromised:** You suspect a keylogger or banking virus, or unauthorized transactions appear.
* **The Infection Won't Go Away:** Multiple professional scans (Malwarebytes, ADWCleaner) don't solve the problem, or the computer keeps getting reinfected.
* **You're Not Comfortable:** Following the removal steps seems too complicated, or you're worried about damaging important data.
* **Critical Business Systems:** Your livelihood or regulatory compliance depends on the computer.

### Questions to Ask a Computer Repair Service:

* "Do you **guarantee** your virus removal work?"
* "Will you **back up my data** before starting?"
* "How will you help **prevent this** from happening again?"

## Chapter Summary: Key Takeaways

Review the most critical concepts learned in this chapter to cement your foundation:

* **No single antivirus program is perfect**—professionals use multiple tools.

* **Good habits are your best protection.** Most infections are preventable.

### Professional Insight:

> "The knowledge you gain here isn't just theory—it's the front-line reality that keeps our clients secure and productive."

## What's Next?

In **Chapter 7**, we'll cover **What to Do If You're Infected**—the essential knowledge you need to follow the exact step-by-step procedures we use to eliminate malware.

**Remember:** The people who get infected the least aren't necessarily the most tech-savvy - they're the most cautious. When in doubt, don't click. It's easier to prevent an infection than to clean one.
