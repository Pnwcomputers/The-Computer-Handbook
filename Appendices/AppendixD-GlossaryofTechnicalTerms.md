# Appendix D: Glossary of Technical Terms
## Technical Terms Explained in Simple Language

***

### Part I: Computer Fundamentals & Hardware
* **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The "brain" of the computer. It performs all calculations and executes program instructions.
* **RAM (Random Access Memory):** The computer's temporary, short-term "workspace." Data here is accessed quickly but lost when the computer is turned off.
* **SSD (Solid State Drive):** A type of storage (long-term memory) that uses flash memory chips. It is much faster and quieter than a traditional Hard Drive (HDD).
* **HDD (Hard Disk Drive):** Traditional long-term storage that uses spinning magnetic platters. Slower than an SSD.
* **Motherboard:** The main circuit board that connects all the computer's components (CPU, RAM, Storage) and allows them to communicate.
* **Operating System (OS):** The main software (like Windows or macOS) that manages the computer's resources and provides the user interface.
* **Software:** Programs and instructions that tell the computer what to do (e.g., Windows, Microsoft Word, games).
* **Hardware:** The physical parts of the computer that you can touch (e.g., monitor, keyboard, CPU, hard drive).
* **Ports (USB, HDMI, Ethernet):** Physical connection points on the computer used to attach external devices or network cables.

### Part II: Cybersecurity & Threats
* **Malware (Malicious Software):** A general term for any software designed to cause damage, steal information, or gain unauthorized access.
* **Virus:** A type of malware that replicates itself and spreads to other files and computers, often causing data damage.
* **Adware:** Software that bombards the user with unwanted advertisements, often bundled with other programs.
* **Spyware:** Software that secretly monitors a user's activity (passwords, keystrokes) and reports the data to criminals.
* **Ransomware:** Malware that encrypts (locks) a victim's files and demands a ransom payment to unlock them.
* **Phishing:** A fraudulent attempt, usually made through email or text, to trick an individual into revealing sensitive information (like passwords or credit card numbers) by posing as a legitimate entity.
* **Rootkit:** Malware that embeds deep within the operating system to hide itself and often disables security software.
* **Social Engineering:** The psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information (e.g., fake tech support calls).
* **Antivirus Software:** A security program designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software, viruses, and other threats.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** A security method that requires two different forms of verification (e.g., a password and a code from your phone) to access an account.

### Part III: Maintenance, Performance & Recovery
* **Bloatware (PUPs):** Unnecessary software (often trial versions or low-quality utilities) pre-installed on a computer or bundled with other installations that slows performance.
* **Thermal Throttling:** A safety mechanism where the CPU automatically slows down its performance when it detects dangerously high temperatures due to poor cooling.
* **Disk Defragmentation:** A process of reorganizing data on a traditional HDD to optimize access speed. (This is unnecessary and potentially harmful on an SSD).
* **System Restore Point:** A snapshot of your computer's system files and settings saved at a specific time, allowing you to "roll back" the system if a new program or update causes problems.
* **3-2-1 Backup Rule:** A professional backup strategy: Keep at least 3 copies of your data, store copies on 2 different types of media, and keep 1 copy offsite (cloud or remote location).
* **File History:** A Windows built-in utility that automatically backs up personal files to an external drive, keeping multiple versions for recovery.
* **Print Spooler:** A Windows service that temporarily stores print jobs and manages the communication between the computer and the printer. Issues often cause stuck print jobs.
* **OODA Loop:** A systematic decision-making process used in troubleshooting: Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act.

### Part IV: Networking & Advanced Systems
* **Router:** A device that connects multiple computers and devices together to form a local area network (LAN) and manages traffic between them.
* **Modem:** A device that converts the signal from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) (e.g., cable, fiber) into a usable internet signal for your router or computer.
* **WiFi SSID:** The name of your wireless network (e.g., "HomeNetwork5G").
* **Static IP:** A fixed, non-changing IP address assigned to a device (like a printer) to ensure consistent connectivity on a network.
* **IP Address:** A unique numerical label assigned to every device connected to a computer network (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
* **DNS (Domain Name System):** The system that translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into numerical IP addresses.
* **Ping:** A command-line tool used to test the reachability and response time of a device on a network.
* **BIOS/UEFI:** Firmware that initializes and tests system hardware components when the computer is first turned on, managing the boot process.
* **IoT (Internet of Things):** Physical devices (like smart speakers, thermostats, or security cameras) embedded with sensors and software that connect and exchange data over the internet.

### Part V: Account & Future Planning
* **Password Manager:** A software application used to securely store and manage unique, complex login credentials for multiple online accounts.
* **Master Password:** The single, strong password used to unlock and access all the passwords stored within a password manager.
* **Credential Manager (Windows):** A built-in Windows utility that securely stores login credentials for websites, applications, and network resources.
* **Identity Theft:** The fraudulent acquisition and use of a person's private identifying information (like SSN, account numbers, or name) usually for financial gain.
* **Future-Proofing:** Making purchasing and configuration decisions today that will maximize the lifespan and relevance of a computer system over the next 5–10 years.
